My goal is to keep up with coding while doing my masters in digital transformation. These are my projects so far:

Uni projects - IT and management studies (bachelor level):
-  **[Parking app](https://github.com/Marisolos/APP200v-Team-08)** â€“ A web application built with **Vue.js** and **Firebase**, with some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
-  **[Media Streaming App](https://github.com/agyCoding/Objetorientert-Analyse-Design)** â€“ A **Java** application for streaming media. I contributed to the system architecture and project documentation.

Uni projects - Digital Transformation (master level):
-  **[Data but make it everything IT](https://github.com/Marisolos/DataButMakeitEverythingIT)** â€“ A project (in progress) using **Python** to identify trends in the information systems field. Developed for the course _Emerging Trends in Information Systems_.

Other projects:
-  **[Case Processing Simulator](https://github.com/Marisolos/saksbehandlingssimulator)** â€“ Streamlit-based case processing simulator with **SQLite** backend, **Python** rule engine, dynamic filtering, statistics, and CSV export.
